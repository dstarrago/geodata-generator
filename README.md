# geodata-generator
Geometric concept data generator for testing classification algorithms

It is used to create data sets representing  a geometric concept. The created data sets have two descriptive attributes corresponding to the two coordinates of a cartesian point, and a class attribute which is true if the point lie inside the geometric concept and false otherwise. A number of geometric concepts, with different boundary complexities, are available to be modeled. 

It can be used to study classification algorithms performance, data complexity characterization, and meta-learning among other machine learning topics. Particularly, it was used in:
